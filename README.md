# Tic-Tac-Toe

**Deployed here: https://tic-tac-toe-8abf7.web.app/**

Tic Tac Toe has been one of the most played games of our childhood, so thought of refreshing some childhood memories with this one.

A responsive Tic Tac Toe which can be played across all devices.
For now it's playable on a single device, but soon I will be adding the support to play
the game on multiple devices at the same time.
