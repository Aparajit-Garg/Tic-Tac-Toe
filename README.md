# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic Tac Toe has been one of the most played games of our childhood and today also,
it's a nice time killing game.

So, here you go, a responsive Tic Tac Toe which can be played across all devices.
For now it's playable on a single device, but soon I will be adding the support to play
the game on multiple devices at the same time.

Will soon be deploying this, until then:

To run the project locally:
1) Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Aparajit-Garg/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
2) Navigate inside the folder
3) Open the terminal and run -> npm install
4) Now, run -> npm start
